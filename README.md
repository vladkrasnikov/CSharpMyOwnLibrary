TASK: Write a class to implement vectors of 3-dimensional space with real ones coefficients. <br />
The implementation must contain:<br />
a) vector length calculation function, Length method and static function
finding the distance between the vectors;<br />
b) properties for accessing vector coordinates and IsInteger properties and
IsPositive.<br />
c) operations on vectors (+, -, scalar and vector products);<br />
d) support for ICloneable, IEnumerable, IComparable interfaces.<br />
Requirements for work:<br />
In the developed classes it is necessary to implement such concepts of OOP as "inheritance" and "polymorphism". You need to describe the base class (ancestor class) and inherit from it.<br />
Part of the functionality of the classes must be implemented using
properties. You also need to support the serialization of class objects.<br /> In addition, you need to describe your own interface, describe in it at least 2
methods or properties and implement them in the classroom. One of the methods must be implemented as an extension method.<br />
Each class must contain at least two constructors, at least
one static method and overriding the ToString () method.<br />
You cannot use classes from namespaces when writing classes
System.Linq, System.Collection.Generic and System.Collection (lists, associative
arrays, queues, stacks, sets, etc.) <br />
Be sure to test all implemented features using
test project and unit tests
